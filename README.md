# ISO 20022 Payment Data Transformation

In this project I made an XSLT stylesheet for ISO 20022 XML data into an easily readable HTML table. The ISO number in ISO 20022 identifies the type, purpose, and version of a standardized financial message, wich in this case is a Customer Credit Transfer Initiation Message (pain.001).

## Included features

**Message ID** (PmtInfId) : This serves as a unique identifier for each payment information block, ensuring traceability and clarity, which helps users distinguish between different payment requests.

**Number of Transactions (NbOfTxs)** : Indicates the total number of individual transactions within a payment block whcih gives a quick overview of the transaction scale.

**Control Sum (CtrlSum)** : Represents the cumulative monetary value of the transactions in the payment block, offers insight into the financial size of the payment operation as well.

**Debtor Name (Dbtr/Nm)** : Identifies the entity initiating the payment. Essential for understanding who is responsible for the payment.

**Debtor IBAN (DbtrAcct/Id/IBAN)** : Specifies the debtorâ€™s account identifier. It also enhances traceability and ensures accuracy in financial reporting.

**Currency (DbtrAcct/Ccy)** : Indicates the currency of the payment transaction. Provides context for international payments and exchange rate considerations.

## Excluded features

To maintain simplicity and focus, I excluded the following from the summary:

* Detailed Transaction Information (CdtTrfTxInf)
* Agent Details (DbtrAgt and CdtrAgt)
* Charges Information (ChrgsAcct and ChrgBr)
* Execution Date (ReqdExctnDt)
* Identifiers and Metadata (InstrId, EndToEndId)
